# funwithnumbers
This code deals from an infinite deck. Can be used with different number sequences at stoi and home made parse functions. Logic based and has many versions. 
works with numbers in ordedr 1, 2 ,4 on top and bottom functions and 4, 2 ,1 on top and bottom functions.
d can be any positive integer. (referring to variable d at bottom of c++ page)
The pfull versus pful11 gives different results in ASCII regarding a space or not in the generated binary. bitset can be changed indefinitely to a maximum(?). 
The number seed vs. CPu function gives a different locus. 
The else statements in the parse sequence (included vs. excluded) give different locus.
The inversion sequene (4-2-1 vs 1-2-4) gives a different locus on the binary packets but not in the ASCII code (hypothesis, unchecked)
Feel free to expirement with these permutations! 
Just got a GitHub Account and I'm very happy to share!
(Sorry for no comments in the code I made it by myself so I'm putting the comment info in this README)
If I get downloads I'll post my Funwithnumbers.Beta deck with hexadecimal. The hexadecimal (instead of octal) has a strange bug and is a much longer code, but
only sunshine and hearts for characters..
