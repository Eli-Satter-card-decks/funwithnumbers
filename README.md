# funwithnumbers
This code deals from an infinite deck. Can be used with different number sequences at stoi and home made parse functions. Logic based and has many versions. 
works with numbers in ordedr 1, 2 ,4 on top and bottom functions and 4, 2 ,1 on top and bottom functions. d can be any positive integer. (referring to variable d at bottom of c++ page)
The pfull versus pful11 gives different results in ASCII regarding a space or not in the generated binary. bitset can be changed indefinitely to a maximum(?).
